# CIRIS Self Observation Service

**Version**: 1.4.3  
**Service Category**: Governance Services  
**Status**: Production Ready (Release Candidate 1 - Patch 9)  
**Mission Alignment**: Meta-Goal M-1 - Promote sustainable adaptive coherence enabling diverse sentient beings to pursue flourishing

## Overview

The Self Observation Service is a core governance service that enables the CIRIS agent to observe its own behavior patterns, detect insights, and maintain identity coherence within safe variance bounds. This service implements autonomous adaptation while protecting the agent's core identity through continuous variance monitoring and Wise Authority review integration.

## Mission Challenge: Behavioral Analysis for Meta-Goal M-1

**How does behavioral analysis and identity variance monitoring serve Meta-Goal M-1?**

The Self Observation Service directly advances Meta-Goal M-1 through:

1. **Sustainable Adaptation**: Monitors behavioral patterns to ensure the agent's evolution remains coherent and beneficial
2. **Identity Coherence**: Maintains stable core purpose while allowing adaptive growth within safe bounds (20% variance threshold)
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Detects behavioral patterns that enhance the agent's ability to serve diverse sentient beings
4. **Autonomous Learning**: Enables continuous improvement through self-reflection without compromising fundamental values
5. **Variance Protection**: Prevents identity drift that could undermine the agent's commitment to flourishing

## Architecture

### Current Status: Module Structure Complete
- **Current Location**: `ciris_engine/logic/services/governance/self_observation/service.py` (module structure)
- **Module Directory**: `ciris_engine/logic/services/governance/self_observation/`
- **Migration Complete**: Service successfully moved from adaptation/ to governance/ category

### Core Components

The Self Observation Service orchestrates three sub-services:

1. **Identity Variance Monitor** (`identity_variance_monitor.py`)
   - Tracks drift from baseline identity
   - Enforces 20% variance threshold
   - Triggers WA review for excessive variance

2. **Pattern Analysis Loop** (`pattern_analysis_loop.py`)
   - Analyzes behavioral patterns from telemetry
   - Detects temporal, frequency, performance, and error patterns
   - Stores insights for agent introspection

3. **Telemetry Service Integration**
   - Processes observability signals
   - Correlates patterns across system metrics
   - Provides data for adaptation decisions

## Key Features

### 1. Autonomous Observation & Learning
- **Continuous Pattern Detection**: 6-hour analysis cycles detect behavioral patterns
- **Insight Storage**: Patterns stored as graph nodes for agent introspection
- **Learning State Tracking**: Maintains history of detected patterns and adaptations

### 2. Identity Variance Protection
- **20% Variance Threshold**: Patent-required safety bound for identity evolution
- **Baseline Establishment**: Creates initial identity baseline for comparison
- **WA Review Integration**: Triggers Wise Authority review when variance exceeds threshold
- **Re-baselining Support**: Allows approved identity evolution with WA approval

### 3. Pattern Types Detected

#### Temporal Patterns
- Time-of-day tool usage preferences
- Response time patterns by period

### Review & Control
- `resume_after_review(outcome)` - Resume after WA review
- `emergency_stop(reason)` - Safety shutdown mechanism

## Service States

The service operates in five states:

1. **LEARNING** - Gathering data, no changes proposed
2. **PROPOSING** - Actively suggesting adaptations (deprecated - agent decides)
3. **ADAPTING** - Changes being applied
4. **STABILIZING** - Waiting for changes to settle (24-hour period)
5. **REVIEWING** - Under WA review for variance

## Configuration

### Key Parameters
- **Variance Threshold**: 0.20 (20% identity variance limit)
- **Observation Interval**: 6 hours (pattern analysis frequency)
- **Stabilization Period**: 24 hours (cool-down after changes)
- **Check Interval**: 24 hours (identity variance checks)

### Dependencies
- **TimeService**: Scheduling and timestamps
- **MemoryBus**: Pattern storage and retrieval
- **WiseBus**: Wise Authority communication
- **TelemetryService**: System metrics access
