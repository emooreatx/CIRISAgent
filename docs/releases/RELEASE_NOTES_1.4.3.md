# Release Notes - CIRIS v1.4.3

**Release Date**: September 2025
**Branch**: 1.4.3-beta
**Focus**: Real Metrics Implementation - 362 Operational Metrics with Zero Placeholders + CIRISLens Support

## 🎯 Major Features

### 1. Complete Real Metrics Implementation
Delivered comprehensive real metrics collection across all 36 metric sources - every metric returns actual operational data, not placeholders.

**362 Real Operational Metrics:**
- **275 PULL-based metrics**: Collected on-demand from services via `get_metrics()`
- **87 PUSH-based metrics**: Real-time event tracking via `memorize_metric()`
- **36 metric sources**: 22 services + 6 buses + 5 components + 3 adapters
- **NO FALLBACK ZEROS**: Services without metrics return empty dict, not fake data
- **30-second smart caching**: 95% reduction in service load
- **Multiple export formats**: JSON, Prometheus, Graphite

**Real Metrics Per Source:**
- **Core Services (22)**: Each implements `get_metrics()` with 4-7 real metrics
- **Message Buses (6)**: Track actual message flow and routing
- **Components (5)**: Monitor operational state (circuit breakers, queues, etc.)
- **Adapters (3+)**: Track real requests and connections

**Key Metrics Categories (All Real Data):**
- LLM usage (actual tokens, costs from OpenAI API)
- Service health (real uptime, request counts, error rates)
- Resource utilization (actual CPU, memory, disk from system)
- Handler performance (real execution times and counts)
- Database metrics (actual node/edge counts, storage size)
- Message bus traffic (real message routing and broadcasts)

### 2. Channel ID Support for Discord Integration
- Added `channel_id` parameter to all action schemas
- Enables proper Discord channel routing
- Maintains backward compatibility with optional fields

### 3. CIRISLens Visibility Platform Support (NEW)
Comprehensive telemetry improvements for CIRISLens integration:
- **Instance Tracking**: Adapter instances tracked with unique IDs (discord_0567, api_759F)
- **Three-Level Aggregation**: Bus level, Type level, Instance level metrics
- **Covenant Metrics**: New ethics/governance category tracking:
  - Wise Authority deferrals
  - Filter interventions
  - Covenant compliance rate
  - Transparency score
- **Dynamic Topology**: Support for runtime service instance creation/destruction
- **External Module Support**: Tracks metrics from ciris_modular_services
- **36 Validated Source Types**: Rigorous analysis and categorization

### 4. Telemetry Source Analysis
Complete documentation of metric architecture:
- **Static Types**: 36 metric source types identified and validated
- **Dynamic Instances**: Unbounded runtime instances properly tracked
- **Bus Registration**: Adapters create service instances that register on buses
- **External Modules**: Support for wisdom providers (geo, weather, sensor)
- **Documentation**: Created TELEMETRY_SOURCES_ANALYSIS.md with full taxonomy

### 5. Managed User Attributes Protection
Prevents LLM from setting system-managed attributes to maintain data integrity:
- `user_id`, `agent_id`, `thread_id` cannot be set via memorize
- System automatically manages these fields
- Protects against identity confusion

## 🚨 Critical Bug Fixes

### 1. ResourceMetricData Duplicate Class Definition
**Severity**: CRITICAL
- **Issue**: telemetry.py contained duplicate class definitions causing Pydantic validation failures
- **Impact**: Would have caused production API failures for resource monitoring endpoints
- **Fix**: Renamed local class to `ResourceTimeSeriesData` and properly utilized schema's `ResourceMetricData`
- **Principle**: Reinforces "No Dicts, No Strings, No Kings" - proper schema usage throughout

### 2. TelemetryAggregator Constructor Mismatch
**Severity**: HIGH
- **Issue**: Fallback telemetry path passed incorrect arguments to TelemetryAggregator
- **Impact**: Complete failure of unified telemetry endpoint when primary aggregator unavailable
- **Fix**: Corrected constructor call to pass `(service_registry, time_service)` instead of `app_state`
- **Added**: Graceful degradation when required services unavailable

### 3. Missing Metric Fallback Logic
**Severity**: MEDIUM
- **Issue**: Metrics endpoint returned empty data when `query_metrics` method unavailable
- **Impact**: Loss of telemetry visibility during service degradation
- **Fix**: Added proper fallback to `get_metrics()` method ensuring telemetry always available

### 4. Stale Log File Bug
**Severity**: HIGH
- **Issue**: Logs endpoint returned previous session's logs instead of current
- **Impact**: Incorrect operational visibility and potential security issue
- **Fix**: Prioritized current logging handlers over stored paths

### 5. Covenant Metrics Aggregation Bug (NEW)
**Severity**: MEDIUM
- **Issue**: Covenant category caused AttributeError in metrics aggregation
- **Impact**: Test failure when iterating service metrics
- **Fix**: Skip covenant category in _aggregate_service_metrics() as it contains computed metrics not service data

### 6. Template Signature Issues (NEW)
**Severity**: LOW
- **Issue**: Echo templates had invalid signatures after content updates
- **Impact**: Template validation failures
- **Fix**: Re-signed templates with proper Ed25519 signatures

## 📊 Test Coverage Achievements

### Comprehensive Test Suite
- **100% test pass rate**: All 39 telemetry tests passing
- **80%+ coverage target**: Met for telemetry.py (was 30%)
- **Edge case testing**: Added fallback paths and error conditions
- **Mock improvements**: Proper AsyncMock usage throughout

### Production Metrics Alignment
- Aligned all metric names with actual TSDB nodes in production
- Fixed metric trend calculations to require >10% change
- Standardized datetime formats (UTC with 'Z' suffix)
- Added proper metric aggregation for service breakdowns
