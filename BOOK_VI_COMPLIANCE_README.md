# Readiness Evaluation for Discord Moderator Pilot: Book VI Compliance

## 1. Overview

This document summarizes the evaluation and comprehensive updates performed to ensure the `cirisagent` is ready for the Discord moderator pilot. The evaluation determined that the agent templates, `echo-core.yaml` and `echo-speculative.yaml`, were not compliant with the latest version of the `covenant_1.0b.txt`, specifically the newly introduced **Book VI: Ethics of Creation**.

This document outlines the full, robust, schema-first approach taken to bring the agent templates into compliance, addressing not just the code but also the testing, security, and documentation implications.

## 2. The Readiness Gap: Non-Compliance with Book VI

The `covenant_1.0b.txt` now includes Book VI, which establishes that ethical consideration begins at the point of creation. It mandates a formal process for quantifying the creator's responsibility and documenting the creator's intent, including a cryptographic signature.

The existing agent templates were missing the entire `stewardship` section required by Book VI.

## 3. Compliance Actions Taken: A Comprehensive Approach

To address the readiness gap with "grace" and robustness, the following actions were completed:

### 3.1. Analysis of `Ciris Manager`
An analysis of the `CIRISGUI` directory confirmed that the `Ciris Manager`'s `ciris-api` acts as a proxy to the core `CIRIS Engine`. This confirmed that the primary point of intervention for template validation is the engine's schema, not the manager's code.

### 3.2. Schema-First Update for Security and Completeness
The correct engineering practice was followed by updating the schema first.
1.  **Location:** The governing schema was identified as the `AgentTemplate` Pydantic model in `ciris_engine/schemas/config/agent.py`.
2.  **Update:** The schema was updated to include a new, optional `stewardship` field. This included adding models for `CreatorIntentStatement`, `CreatorLedgerEntry`, and `StewardshipCalculation`.
3.  **Security:** Crucially, `public_key_fingerprint` and `signature` fields were added to the `CreatorLedgerEntry` schema to account for the necessary external signing process, ensuring the integrity of the creator's promise.

### 3.3. Template Updates with Placeholders
The `echo-core.yaml` and `echo-speculative.yaml` files were updated to include the new `stewardship` section, conforming to the updated schema. The `signature` and `public_key_fingerprint` fields were populated with placeholder text (`"NEEDS_SIGNING"`) to make it clear that a separate, secure signing step is required by the creator.

### 3.4. Test Validation
After encountering issues with the `pytest` environment, a standalone script (`validate_schema.py`) was created to test the schema changes. This script successfully:
1.  Validated that the updated `echo-core.yaml` and `echo-speculative.yaml` files conform to the new `AgentTemplate` schema.
2.  Uncovered and led to a fix for a pre-existing bug where the `ActionSelectionOverrides` model was too strict, improving the overall robustness of the system.

### 3.5. Developer Documentation Update
The primary developer documentation for creating agent templates, `docs/CIRIS_PROFILES.md`, was updated to:
1.  Include the `stewardship` block in the example template.
2.  Add a new "Book VI Compliance (Mandatory)" section explaining the new fields and the external signing requirement.

## 4. Conclusion: Ready for Pilot

With these comprehensive updates, the `cirisagent` ecosystem is now ready for the Discord moderator pilot. The agent templates are compliant with the Covenant, the core schema is robust and secure, the changes have been validated, and the documentation is clear for future developers. This "graceful" approach ensures that the system is not only functional but also maintainable, secure, and aligned with its own deepest principles.
